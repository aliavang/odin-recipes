        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Wake up to a delicious breakfast of bacon, eggs, a slice of bread, and a slice of cheese. Guaranteed to keep you full for the morning since it is packed with protein and carbs!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 slices of thick cut bacon</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 loaf of bread</li>
            <li>1 slab of cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pan over medium-high heat since we do not have the talking fire from Howl's Moving Castle.</li>
            <li>Add in the 3 slices of bacon once the pan is hot enough. Cook until crispy and push to one side of pan.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and crack in the 4 eggs. Aiming for sunny side up, but cook them to your liking.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut a off desired slice of bread from loaf and plate all the ingredients. Serve and enjoy!</li>
            <li>optional: Toast the bread and lay the room temperature cheese over the hot toast.</li>
        </ol>
